This project  is to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I have worked out to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style. Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
